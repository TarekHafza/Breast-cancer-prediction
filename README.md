# Breast-cancer-prediction
In the final project for the data analysis bootcamp, we will be exploring the ways we can utilize machine learning to predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer. 

# Data Loading
The data that was used can be found using the following link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic
The download will include two files, one of which being a '.data' file and a '.name' file. The data file contains the raw data in the same format as a CSV without headers. The headers are located in the '.name' file and required me to manually input the headers in Excel and export as a csv.
From there I was able to load the data into the python script

# Logistic Regression Python Script
  Dependancies required: From sklearn; StandardScaler, Train Test Split, Logistic Regression, Accuracy score, confusion matrix, f1 score, precision score, recall score,cross validation score. 
  mpl toolkits
  matplotlib
  numpy
  pandas
  seaborn

  # How to run
  First, install dependancies and install the jupyter notebook file in the project files folder. Second, for now you will need to copy and paste the data points from the CSV file but in the future I plan to add a front end interface that would allow users to select patient numbers to see the predictions. Lastly, you will need to paste the data into the second to last cell where the existing data already is. After all this, you will be able to see the prediction made by the logistic regression algorithm.

  # Random Forest Python Script
<<<<<<< Yao's
# Breast-cancer-prediction 
# Data process
Take the .csv file and convert it to the .db file.
Retrieve data from SQL.
# Random forest
## Installation:
sqlite3 for data requests.
Use seaborn for EDA.
StandardScaler,train_test_split,accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, cross_val_score from sklearn for ML.
matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, pandas
## Usage:
Train a Random forest model using existing data, and test the accuracy.
This model could be used in future breast cancer diagnosis prediction.
