# Breast-cancer-prediction
In the final project for the data analysis bootcamp, we will be exploring the ways we can utilize machine learning to predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer. 

#Data Loading
The data that was used can be found using the following link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic
The download will include two files, one of which being a '.data' file and a '.name' file. The data file contains the raw data in the same format as a CSV without headers. The headers are located in the '.name' file and required me to manually input the headers in Excel and export as a csv.
From there I was able to load the data into the python script
